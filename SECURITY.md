# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in **vm2**, please **do not create a public issue**.

Instead, use **[GitHub‚Äôs private vulnerability reporting feature](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/security/advisories/new)** to submit your report securely. This ensures sensitive information is shared privately with the maintainers and not exposed publicly.

Please include as much detail as possible to help us reproduce and assess the issue:
- Steps to reproduce  
- Affected versions  
- Environment and configuration details  
- Potential impact (if known)

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a **responsible disclosure** process:

1. You report the vulnerability privately via GitHub.  
2. We investigate, confirm, and prepare a fix.  
3. Once a fix is released, we‚Äôll credit you (if you wish) in the release notes and security advisory.  
4. Only then will details of the vulnerability be made public.

## Supported Versions

The following versions of **vm2** currently receive security updates:

| Version | Supported | Notes |
|----------|------------|-------|
| 3.x | ‚úÖ | Actively maintained |
| 2.x and older | ‚ùå | No longer supported |

## Commitment

Security is a top priority for this project. We take all reports seriously and aim to resolve verified issues quickly and transparently, with respect for both reporters and users.

Thank you for helping make **vm2** safer for everyone. üôè
