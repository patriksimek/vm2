# vm2 [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/patriksimek/vm2.png)](https://david-dm.org/patriksimek/vm2) [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/vm2.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/vm2) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/patriksimek/vm2.png)](http://travis-ci.org/patriksimek/vm2)

vm2 is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with whitelisted built-in node objects. Securely!

## Features

* Runs untrusted code securely in a single process with your code side by side
* Full control over sandbox's console output
* Sandbox has limited access to process's methods
* Sandbox can require modules (native and external)
* You can limit access to certain (or all) native modules
* You can securely call methods inside sandbox with callbacks
* Is immune to `while (true) {}` (VM only, see docs)
* Is immune to all known methods of attacks
* Coffee-Script support

## How does it work

* It uses internal VM module to create secure context
* It compiles native modules inside a new context
* It overrides native require to control access to modules
* It forces modules (even native ones) to use `use strict`

## Installation

    npm install vm2

## Quick Examples

```javascript
var VM = require('vm2').VM;

var vm = new VM();
vm.run("process.exit()");
```

## 1.x to 2.x changes

`Buffer` class is no longer globally available by default in NodeVM. To make `Buffer` accessible globaly, enable `require` option and make sure `buffer` module is whitelisted. More info in [Known Issues](#known-issues).

## VM

VM is a simple sandbox, without `require` feature, to synchronously run an untrusted code. Only JavaScript built-in objects are available.

**Options:**

* `timeout` - Script timeout in milliseconds. 
* `sandbox` - VM's global object.
* `language` - `javascript` (default) or `coffeescript`
* `transform` - custom function to transform code

```javascript
var VM = require('vm2').VM;

var options = {
    timeout: 1000,
    sandbox: {}
};

var vm = new VM(options);
vm.run("process.exit()"); // throws ReferenceError: process is not defined
```

You can also retrieve values from VM.

```javascript
var number = vm.run("1337"); // returns 1337
```

**IMPORTANT**: Timeout is only effective on code you run through `run`. Timeout is NOT effective on any method returned by VM.

## NodeVM

Unlike `VM`, `NodeVM` lets you require modules same way like in regular Node's context.

**Options:**

* `console` - `inherit` to enable console, `redirect` to redirect to events, `off` to disable console (default: `inherit`)
* `sandbox` - VM's global object
* `language` - `javascript` (default) or `coffeescript`
* `transform` - custom function to transform code
* `require` - `true` to enable `require` method (default: `false`)
* `requireExternal` - `true` to enable `require` of external modules (default: `false`)
* `requireNative` - Array of allowed native modules. (default: all available)
* `requireRoot` - Restricted path where local modules can be required (default: every path)
* `useStrict` - Whether to add `use strict` directive to required modules (default: `true`)

**Available modules:** `assert`, `buffer`, `child_process`, `constants`, `crypto`, `tls`, `dgram`, `dns`, `http`, `https`, `net`, `punycode`, `querystring`, `url`, `domain`, `events`,  `fs`, `path`, `os`, `stream`, `string_decoder`, `timers`, `tty`,  `util`, `sys`, `vm`, `zlib`

**REMEMBER**: The more modules you allow, the more fragile your sandbox becomes.

**IMPORTANT**: Timeout is not effective for NodeVM so it is not immune to `while (true) {}` or similar evil.

```javascript
var NodeVM = require('vm2').NodeVM;

var options = {
	console: 'inherit',
    sandbox: {},
    require: true,
    requireExternal: true,
    requireNative: ['fs', 'path'],
    requireRoot : "./"
};

var vm = new NodeVM(options);
var functionInSandbox = vm.run("module.exports = function(who) { console.log('hello '+ who); }");
```

### Calling VM's methods

Securely call method in sandbox. All arguments except functions are cloned during the process to prevent context leak. Functions are wrapped to secure closures. Buffers are copied.

**IMPORTANT**: Method doesn't check for circular objects! If you send a circular structure as an argument, your process will get stuck in infinite loop.

**IMPORTANT**: Always use `vm.call` method to call methods or callbacks in sandbox. If you call it directly, you are exposing yourself a risk of main global context leakage!

```javascript
vm.call(functionInSandbox, 'world');
```

### Loading modules by relative path

To load modules by relative path, you must pass full path of the script you're running as a second argument of vm's `run` method. Filename then also shows up in any stack traces produced from the script.

```javascript
vm.run("require('foobar')", "/data/myvmscript.js");
```

## CLI

Before you can use vm2 in command line, install it globally with `npm install vm2 -g`.

```
$ vm2 ./script.js
```

## Known Issues

Allowing `buffer` to be required inside NodeVM may crash your app with `TypeError: Invalid non-string/buffer chunk` errors (reported [here](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/issues/22) and [here](https://github.com/patriksimek/vm2/issues/7)). To prevent `buffer` from loading, disable `require` option or remove `buffer` from list of whitelisted native modules. Keep in mind that modules like `fs` or `stream` do require `buffer` internally.
